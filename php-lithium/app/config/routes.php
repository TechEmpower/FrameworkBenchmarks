 * is an integer, uncomment the routes below to enable URLs like `/posts/edit/1138`,
 * `/posts/view/1138.json`, etc.

 * Finally, connect the default route. This route acts as a catch-all, intercepting requests in the
 * following forms:
 *
 * - `/foo/bar`: Routes to `FooController::bar()` with no parameters passed.
 * - `/foo/bar/param1/param2`: Routes to `FooController::bar('param1, 'param2')`.
 * - `/foo`: Routes to `FooController::index()`, since `'index'` is assumed to be the action if none
 *   is otherwise specified.
 *
 * In almost all cases, custom routes should be added above this one, since route-matching works in
 * a top-down fashion.
