Here's what you need to stick to in order to have the best chance of getting your code pushed to the core:

 * **Integration**: all pull requests should be submitted against the [`dev`](https://github.com/UnionOfRAD/lithium/tree/dev) branch for integration testing
 * **Conceptual integrity**: code should conform to the goals of the framework
 * **Maintainability**: code should pass existing tests, have adequate test coverage and should conform to our coding standards & QA guidelines
 * **Comprehensibility**: code should be concise and expressive, and should be accompanied by new documentation as appropriate, or updates to existing docs
