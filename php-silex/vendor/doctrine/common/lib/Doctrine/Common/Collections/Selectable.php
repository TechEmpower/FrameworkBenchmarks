/**
 * Interface for collections that allow efficient filtering with an expression API.
 *
 * Goal of this interface is a backend independent method to fetch elements
 * from a collections. {@link Expression} is crafted in a way that you can
 * implement queries from both in-memory and database-backed collections.
 *
 * For database backed collections this allows very efficient access by
 * utilizing the query APIs, for example SQL in the ORM. Applications using
 * this API can implement efficient database access without having to ask the
 * EntityManager or Repositories.
