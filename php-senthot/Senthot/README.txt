application scope of development and needs to be expanded to suit different levels of developer
demand. And introduce a new CBD (Core+Behavior+Driven) schema Mode, designed to create a framework for DIY
and AOP programming experience, so that Senthot can in different ways to quickly meet the needs of projects and applications,
and the official introduction of Cloud, REST and Mongo support.

Build DIY custom at the bottom and the framework class AOP programming experience. Take advantage of this new feature, developers can
easy Mode Expansion for their own tailored for your own or enterprise development framework.
Compile mechanism: original project compilation mechanisms, effectively reduce the performance overhead of OOP development file loading.
Improved project compilation mechanisms can Support compile-load files directly as a portal, and constant support
external load, conducive to product release.

Class library import: based on imported namespaces and class library class library class library import looks more
add simple and clear, but also Support automatic loading and import alias. In order to facilitate cross-platform porting project,
Loaded System can also check the size of the file to write.

Routing and URL: System support normal Mode, and PATHINFOMode, and REWRITEMode and Compatibility Mode
URL, Support different deployment server and the Mode of operation, with the URL routing features, let your heart
SEO optimized URL address and construction needs. Support flexible rules route road
and redirect Routing Support, developers are more convenient and flexible URL optimization experience.

Debug Mode: Debug Mode can provide the framework easy to Use for different stages of the development process, including development,
testing and demonstrations of any kind, including the requirements of different Mode can be configured independent of the project profile is applied.
Just a small sacrifice will be able to meet the performance of debug logging and analysis of needs in the development process, and to ensure that future
deployed smoothly once switch to the deployment Mode you can quickly increase performance.

ORM : Simple and lightweight ORM implementation, combined with simple CURD and ARMode, development efficiency are everywhere.

Database Support including Mysql, Sqlite, Pgsql, Oracle, SqlServer, Mongo and other databases,
and built in Distributed databases and separate functions to read and write Support. System support multiple database connections and dynamic switch
mechanism, a cutting edge enterprise development, cross-database applications and DistributedSupport worry-free.

Query language: built-in rich query mechanism, including combination queries, fast, complex queries, the query interval
positioning query, statistical inquiries, queries, multiple-table query, subquery, dynamic and native queries, you
simple and efficient data queries.

Dynamic model: there is no need to create any model that corresponds to the class easily CURD operation is completed, Support a variety of models
dynamic switching, give you a data manipulation is very nice and the best possible experience.

Extended model: provides a rich extension model, including the following: Serialization Support, read-only field, text field,
delayed write, optimistic locking, data tables and advanced features such as advanced modeling; easy to dynamically create
database view models Support correlation model of associated actions; SupportMongo Mongo of the database model
and so on, are easy to use.

Group modules: don't worry about the big project Division of coordination and deployment issues, 
grouped to help you overcome the challenges across projects,
second-level domain name of the Support Group the deployment Support.

Template engine: System built in a remarkable piece of compiled template engine for XML-based, Support two types of
template tags, integration of Smarty and JSP tag library, and a built-in layout templates and tag library extension
support. Through drive can also be Support Smarty, TemplateLite, others, such as Smart
Third-party templating engine.

return to the client, and can be extended to return the data format, System does not bind any AJAX libraries, free
familiarize yourself with the operation of the AJAX Library.

Cloud engines Support: provides a powerful platform and Cloud Platform Support, "across" and "smoothness", localized Support
development and debugging, and deploying switch lets you easily transition to build a new development experience.

RESTFul support:RESTMode provides RESTFul support, for you to design and build a new URL access experience,
also provides Support for application interfaces.

Multiple language Support:System support language pack features, projects and groups can have a separate language packs and can be
automatic detection of browser language is automatically loaded the corresponding language pack.

Mode Expansion: in addition to the standard Mode, it also provides the AMF, PHPRpc, Lite, Thin and CliMode Expansion.
For different levels of core provides the best application development framework, you can also customize Mode Expansion.

Automatically verify and complete: auto complete form data validation and filtering, the new version of IP is added validity and validation testing
more authentication methods such as card, combined with auto-completion can build secure data objects.

Field type detection: the System will automatically cache the field type and field information, Support illegal field filters and fields classes
type casting to ensure that writes data to and query the safer.
