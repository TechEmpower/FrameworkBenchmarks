# GEMINIHELLO configuration file
#
# BASELINE Configuration
#
# This configuration file specifies application default behavior that is
# suitable where not superseded by deployment-specific configuration
# files.  Refer to the separate deployment-specific configuration files
# (such as GeminiHello-Dev.conf).
#
# The automatically-generated configuration files align with generic
# deployment "roles" (Development, Test, and Production).  It is common
# practice, however, to have additional machine-specific configuration 
# files.  This allows for configuration attributes to be distributed
# between so that, for example, all development environments can use
# attributes specific in a Development configuration file.  For example:
#
#    GeminiHello.conf - Baseline configuration
#    GeminiHello-Dev.conf - Standard development configuration specifics
#    GeminiHello-BLACKPARK.conf - Specifics for a machine named Blackpark.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# AUTO GENERATED CONFIGURATION FILE NOTICE:
#   Search for lines that contain "EDIT THIS" for AUTO-GENERATED items
#   that you cam edit for additional functionality.
#
# Notes:
#   Lines that begin with # are comments.  Empty lines are ignored.  Each
#   entry in this file is described immediately above the provided value.

#
# STANDARD PROPERTIES
#   Gemini provides the following standard properties dynamically at
#   runtime, derived from the deployment environment.
#
#   All Servlet Initialization Parameters in the following form:
#   Servlet.Parameter.(ParamName) = (Value)
#
#   All Server Attributes in the following form:
#   Servlet.Attribute.(AttribtueName) = (Value)
#
#   Servlet.ContextName - The deployment context name for the web-app.
#   Servlet.DeploymentRoot - The physical file system location for the
#     "document root" of the web-app.
#   Servlet.WebInf - The physical file system location of the web-app's
#     WEB-INF directory.
#   Servlet.MachineName - The discovered machine name of the server.
#   Servlet.ApplicationRoot - One directory above the DeploymentRoot.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# and production to generate links to static assets that can be cached forever.
# This version number is changed every time the ant build script is executed.

# DEPLOYMENT SETTINGS
