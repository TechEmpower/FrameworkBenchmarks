# Limited Travis-CI Verification 

Because the verification system uses the linux-only Travis-CI
service, verifying Windows-only tests has to be done manually
and is very time consuming. 

Consider including an additional test, likely based on Mono and 
FastCGI (e.g. xsp), that can run on Linux when submitting a new
framework. This will drastically speed up our ability to merge
in your pull request. 

# Different Mono Versions

While we have not currently run into the need to have multiple 
simultaneous Mono installations, it is [possible](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/compiling-mono/parallel-mono-environments/)

# Debugging Mono + NuGet

Mono understands an environment variable `MONO_LOG_LEVEL=debug` that is helpful for checking that 
mono is properly working e.g. loading necessary DLL's. 

Most NuGet commands understand a `-Verbosity` flag, which is great because the error messages can be completely
mystifying when working with Mono too. Use this would enable all the debugging you can: 

    $ MONO_LOG_LEVEL=debug mono NuGet2.exe update -Verbosity "detailed" -self

For example, aspnet was constantly failing with this message: 
    
    Could not connect to the feed specified at 'https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/'. Please verify that the package source (located in the Package Manager Settings) is valid and ensure your network connectivity.`. 

Using `-Verbosity "detailed"` shows that the real error is actually a Mono library problem, as so: 

    System.InvalidOperationException: Could not connect to the feed specified at 'https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/'. Please verify that the package source (located in the Package Manager Settings) is valid and ensure your network connectivity. ---> System.Net.WebException: libMonoPosixHelper.so ---> System.DllNotFoundException: libMonoPosixHelper.so
