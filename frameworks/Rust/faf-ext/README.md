# faf-ext is a fork of faf
FaF is a Linux webserver written in Rust. It has a single goal: to demonstrate the upper bound of possible single-node performance. It is meant as a living reference project and may have cutting edge dependencies. Being a reference project, documentation and simplicity are essential and will be maintained to the best of my ability.

Just a small modification to be able to implement all the functionality.
