Version scheme
================
	MAJOR.MINOR[.BUGFIX | .rcN]
	for example, (in order from earliest to latest)
		rel0.1-rc1: 0.1 initial release candidate
		rel0.1: release 0.1 initial release
		rel0.1.1: release 0.1, 1st bugfix release
		stab0.1.10: release 0.1, 10th bugfix release, stable
	* A prefix of "rel" means it is a release version (as opposed to development version), and is suitable for testing on non-critical sites. You can consider this the "testing" stage. The "rel" prefix may be omitted in filenames, and is implied when there is no prefix.
	* Once a release has gone through about 8 cycles of bugfixes, and/or the number and severity of bugs has declined to a very low point, it is considered "stable" and its prefix will be changed to "stab". The bugfix number is not reset, however.

API/ABI stability
	* For performance reasons, only API compability will be maintained. Expect ABI breakages even between different bugfix numbers of the same release.
	* For version 1.0 or higher, API compatibility is maintained for all non-rc releases. For versions below 1.0, API compatibility is maintained for stable releases only.

RELEASE OVERVIEW
================
(as of 2013/07/23)

"maintained" means API is to be kept unchanged
