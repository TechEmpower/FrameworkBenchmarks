# C++/silicon Benchmarking test

Silicon is a C++ web framework located at https://github.com/matt-42/silicon

### Note

The `silicon-epoll-mysql` and `silicon-lwan-mysql` tests are currently not working. They have been removed from the `benchmark_config.json` file but the implementations still exist. You can see the old `benchmark_config.json` [here](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/blob/5d44d57cbb5cbc209a2d6aeb23010b466c055200/frameworks/C%2B%2B/silicon/benchmark_config.json).
