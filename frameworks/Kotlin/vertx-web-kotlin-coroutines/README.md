# Vert.x Web With Kotlin Coroutines Benchmarking Test

This is the Vert.x Web With Kotlin Coroutines portion of a [benchmarking test suite](../) comparing a variety of web development platforms.

This project is adapted from the [Vert.x Web portion](/frameworks/Java/vertx-web) mainly to see how much overhead Kotlin coroutines introduce. See that project for more details.
