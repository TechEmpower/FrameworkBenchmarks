# Vert.x Web With Kotlin Coroutines Benchmarking Test

This is the Vert.x Web With Kotlin Coroutines portion of a [benchmarking test suite](../) comparing a variety of web development platforms.

This project is adapted from the [Vert.x Web portion](/frameworks/Java/vertx-web), with consistent dependency versions, code converted into Kotlin, and all future compositions adapted into coroutine calls, mainly to see how much overhead Kotlin coroutines introduce. See that project for more details.
