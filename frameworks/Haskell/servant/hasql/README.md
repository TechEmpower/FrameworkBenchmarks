# Servant Benchmarking Test

This is the [`servant`](http://haskell-servant.github.io/) implementation of a
[benchmarking test suite](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/) comparing a
variety of web development platforms.

This test uses PostgreSQL via the [`hasql`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hasql)
library.
