# h2o

This is a framework implementation using the [H2O](https://h2o.examp1e.net) HTTP server. It
builds directly on top of `libh2o` instead of running the standalone server.

## Requirements

[CMake](https://cmake.org), [H2O](https://h2o.examp1e.net), [libpq](https://www.postgresql.org),
[mustache-c](https://github.com/x86-64/mustache-c), [numactl](https://github.com/numactl/numactl),
[OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org), [YAJL](https://lloyd.github.io/yajl)

## Test implementations

The test implementations are located into the [src/handlers](src/handlers) directory - refer to
the `initialize_*_handler*()` functions.

## Performance tuning

If the test environment changes, it will probably be necessary to tune some of the framework
settings in order to achieve the best performance possible. The most significant parameters are the
maximum number of database connections per thread and the maximum number of pipelined database
queries per database connection, which are controlled by the `DB_CONN` and the `DB_PIPELINE`
variables respectively in the `h2o.sh` script.

## Performance issues

### Plaintext

`libh2o` performs at least one system call per pipelined response.
