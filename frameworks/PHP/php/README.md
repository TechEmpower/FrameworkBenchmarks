#PHP Benchmarking Test

This is the PHP portion of a [benchmarking test suite](../) comparing a variety of web development platforms.

### Important
When editing this framework, be sure to force add the files changed. Most files were added to .gitignore, as the framework touches some of them during testing.

### JSON Encoding Test
Use the PHP standard [JSON encoder](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php)

* [JSON test source](json.php)

### Data-Store/Database Mapping Test

* [Database test source Raw](dbraw.php)
* [Database test source ORM](dborm.php)
