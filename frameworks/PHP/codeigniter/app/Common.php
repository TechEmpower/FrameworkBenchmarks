 * The goal of this file is to allow developers a location

 * replace them with their own. This file is loaded during
 * the bootstrap process and is called during the framework's
 * execution.
 *
 * This can be looked at as a `master helper` file that is
 * loaded early on, and may also contain additional functions
 * that you'd like to use throughout your entire application
