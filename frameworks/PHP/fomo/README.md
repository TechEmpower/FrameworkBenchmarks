# Introduction

Fomo is a web application framework based.

We tried to implement Fomo in the simplest possible way so that anyone can use it.

Fomo supports the following:

- Simple, fast routing engine.
- Processing work in the background.
- Queued job processing.
- And more...

Fomo is very fast, simple and for use in large scale projects.

# Original intention

Here's 3 reason why you should use Fomo:

- Fomo is very simple (less to learn and train others on).
- Fomo is very fast (uses fewer resources to do the same thing).
- Fomo is another tool that developers can use to solve their complex problems in a simple way.
