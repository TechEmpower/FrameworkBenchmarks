# Dependency Management

While installing Perl, the [`cpanm`](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/App-cpanminus/bin/cpanm)
client is installed as well as the more advanced [`Carton`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Carton).
Carton can be used to declare and use project specific dependencies with more fine grained control
of versions and even pin the specific versions used during development.

# Where to get help

Perl advice can be found in #perl on freenode or on any number of channels on irc.perl.org.
Frameworks might declare specific app maintainers in their app's README files.
