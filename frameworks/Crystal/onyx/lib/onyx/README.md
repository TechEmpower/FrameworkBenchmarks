## About üëã

This shard (should be called *Onyx/Onyx*) includes a number of convenient macros for easier day-to-day development with the [Onyx Framework](https://onyxframework.org). It convers almost all of its components:

* Top-level macros:
  * [Env](#env) to load environment variables from `.env` files
  * [Logger](#logger) to enable `Onyx.logger`
  * [DB](#db) to enable `Onyx.db`
* [Onyx::HTTP macros](#http) for use with [Onyx::HTTP](https://github.com/onyxframework/http)
* [Onyx::REST macros](#rest) for use with [Onyx::REST](https://github.com/onyxframework/rest)
* [Onyx::SQL macros](#sql) for use with [Onyx::SQL](https://github.com/onyxframework/sql)

## Installation üì•

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  onyx:
    github: onyxframework/onyx
    version: ~> 0.1.0
```

This shard follows [Semantic Versioning v2.0.0](http://semver.org/), so check [releases](https://github.com/onyxframework/rest/releases) and change the `version` accordingly. Please visit [github.com/crystal-lang/shards](https://github.com/crystal-lang/shards) to know more about Crystal shards.

Note that this shard does **not** have implicit dependencies for other framework components. For example, to use `"onyx/http"` macros, you must add `onyx-http` dependendency as well:

```yaml
dependencies:
  onyx:
    github: onyxframework/onyx
    version: ~> 0.1.0
  onyx-http:
    github: onyxframework/http
    version: ~> 0.1.0
```

## Usage üíª

### Env

Firstly sets `CRYSTAL_ENV` environment variable to `"development"` if not set yet. Then loads other environment variables from `.env` files in this order, overwriting if defined multiple times:

1. `.env` file
2. `.env.local` file
3. `.env.#{CRYSTAL_ENV}` file
3. `.env.#{CRYSTAL_ENV}.local` file

It also enables `.runtime_env` and `.buildtime_env` top-level macros which raise if an environment variable is not defined.

```crystal
require "onyx/env"

# At this point, all variables are loaded from .env files
#

runtime_env DATABASE_URL # Will raise on program start if DATABASE_URL variable is missing
```

This feature is powered by [dotenv](https://github.com/gdotdesign/cr-dotenv) shard by @gdotdesign.

### Logger

Enables using the singleton `Onyx.logger` instance. It automatically requires [Env](#env).

```crystal
require "onyx/logger"

Onyx.logger.info("Hello world!")
```

```sh
DEBUG [12:45:52.520 #13543] Hello world!
```

### DB

Enables using the singleton `Onyx.db` instance. It automatically requires [Env](#env) and **raises** if no `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is defined *or* the database is not reachable.

```crystal
require "onyx/db"

Onyx.db.query("SELECT 1")
```

### HTTP

Enables the singleton [Onyx::HTTP](https://github.com/onyxframework/http) instance. It automatically requires [Env](#env) and [Logger](#logger) and adds the following methods:

* `Onyx.get`, `Onyx.post`, `Onyx.put`, `Onyx.patch`, `Onyx.delete` and `Onyx.options` which call the according [`Onyx::HTTP::Router`](https://api.onyxframework.org/http/Onyx/HTTP/Router.html) method
* `Onyx.draw` which calls `Onyx::HTTP::Router#draw`
* `Onyx.listen` which launches the [`Onyx::HTTP::Server`](https://api.onyxframework.org/http/Onyx/HTTP/Server.html) instance

Example:

```crystal
require "onyx/http"

Onyx.get "/" do |env|
  env.response << "Hello Onyx"
end

Onyx.listen
```

```sh
> curl http://localhost:5000
Hello Onyx
```

You **must** manually add [Onyx::HTTP](https://github.com/onyxframework/http) as a dependency in your `shard.yml`.

### REST

Enables the singleton [Onyx::HTTP](https://github.com/onyxframework/rest) instance. It automatically requires [HTTP](#http) and adds `Onyx.render` method:

```crystal
require "onyx/rest"

struct MyView
  include Onyx::REST::View

  def initialize(@foo : String)
  end

  text("foo = #{@foo}")
end

Onyx.render(:text) # Or :json

Onyx.get "/" do |env|
  env.response.view = MyView.new("bar")
end

Onyx.listen
```

You **must** manually add [Onyx::REST](https://github.com/onyxframework/rest) as a dependency in your `shard.yml`.

### SQL

Enables the singleton [Onyx::SQL](https://github.com/onyxframework/sql) [`Repository`](https://api.onyxframework.org/sql/Onyx/SQL/Repository.html) instance accessible with `Onyx.repo` method and also adds proxy `Onyx.query`, `Onyx.exec` and `Onyx.repo` methods. It automatically requires [Env](#env) and [DB](#db) (meaning that you **must** have `DATABASE_URL` variable defined).

```crystal
require "onyx/sql"

class User
  include Onyx::SQL::Model

  schema users do
    pkey id : Int32
    type name : String
  end
end

users = Onyx.query(User.where(id: 42)).first?
```
