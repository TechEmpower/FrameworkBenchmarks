## About üëã

Onyx::SQL is an SQL ORM for the [Crystal Language](https://crystal-lang.org). It features handy schema definition DSL and powerful type-safe query builder. It preserves composition and has a decent API documentation.

It is a part of [Onyx Framework](https://onyxframework.org), but it is **not** strictly tied to it. You absolutely can use this ORM with a web framework other than [Onyx::HTTP](https://github.com/onyxframework/http) and [Onyx::REST](https://github.com/onyxframework/rest).

It implements the [crystal-db](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-db) API, which makes it usable with any SQL database! It has been successfully tested with the following DBs:

- [x] SQLite3
- [x] PostgreSQL
- [ ] MySQL (*coming soon*)

This ORM, as all other Onyx components, targets to be easily understandble for newcomers, but be able to grow with a developers's knowledge. Fundamentally, it relies on extremely powerful Crystal annotations, but they may be tedious for daily tasks, that why they're hidden by default under the convenient schema DSL. See the examples below.

## Installation üì•

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  onyx-sql:
    github: onyxframework/sql
    version: ~> 0.6.1
```

This shard follows [Semantic Versioning v2.0.0](http://semver.org/), so check [releases](https://github.com/onyxframework/sql/releases) and change the `version` accordingly. Please visit [github.com/crystal-lang/shards](https://github.com/crystal-lang/shards) to know more about Crystal shards.

You'd also need to add a database dependency conforming the [crystal-db](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-db) interface. For example, [pg](https://github.com/will/crystal-pg):

```yaml
dependencies:
  onyx-sql:
    github: onyxframework/sql
    version: ~> 0.6.0
  pg:
    github: will/crystal-pg
    version: ~> 0.15.0
```

## Usage üíª

The API docs are hosted at <https://api.onyxframework.org/sql>, and they're pretty comprehensive. Don't hesistate to read them all after you're done with this section!

It's a good idea to get yourself familiar with the [Crystal DB docs](https://crystal-lang.org/reference/database/) before moving on.

### 101 üìñ

As any other ORM, Onyx::SQL allows to define models which will be mapped to SQL tables. Assuming that you have the following table in a PostgreSQL database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id    SERIAL  PRIMARY KEY,
  name  TEXT    NOT NULL
);
```

> **Note:** Onyx::SQL does not provide any tools for migrations. Check [migrate.cr](https://github.com/vladfaust/migrate.cr) for a production-ready solution.

Then in your code you would do:

```crystal
require "pg"
require "onyx-sql"

class User
  include Onyx::SQL::Model

  schema users do
    pkey id : Int32
    type name : String
  end
end

db = DB.open("postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/my_db")

user = User.new(name: "John")
rs = db.query(*user.insert.returning(User).build(true))

users = User.from_rs(rs)
user = users.first

pp user.id # => 1
```

Congratulations, you've successfully inserted a brand new User instance! :tada:

> **Note:** `.build(true)` is required instead of simple `.build` because PostgreSQL has different syntax for query arguments (`$n` instead of `?`).

#### Querying

```crystal
rs = db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1", 1)
user = User.from_rs(rs).first

pp user # => <User @id=1 @name="John">
```

#### Updating

You can easily update models with the [`Changeset`](https://api.onyxframework.org/sql/Onyx/SQL/Model/Changeset.html) concept:

```crystal
changeset = user.changeset
changeset.update(name: "Jake")

db.exec(*user.update(changeset).build(true))
```

#### Deletion

Deleting from DB is simple as well:

```crystal
db.exec(*user.delete.build(true))
```

### Repository

Onyx::SQL has the [`Onyx::SQL::Repository`](https://api.onyxframework.org/sql/Onyx/SQL/Repository.html) class, which effectively wraps the database connection with logging, automatically builds queries and more:

```crystal
repo = Onyx::SQL::Repository.new(db)

user = User.new(name: "Archer")
user = repo.query(user.insert.returning(User)).first

# [postgresql] INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES (?)
# 1.234ms
```

### Query

[`Onyx::SQL::Query`](https://api.onyxframework.org/sql/Onyx/SQL/Query.html) is a powerful type-safe SQL query builder with almost all SQL methods implemented:

```crystal
query = User.select(:name).where(id: 2)
pp query       # => <Onyx::SQL::Query(User) ...>
pp query.build # => {"SELECT users.name FROM users WHERE id = ?", {2}}
```

`Query` is just an object which could be expanded into a pair of SQL string a query params. You can then use it however you want:

```crystal
sql, params = query.build(true)
rs = db.query(sql, params)

# Or shorter
rs = db.query(*query.build(true))

# Or with repository
user = repo.query(query).first
```

### References

Onyx::SQL has a native support for model references, both direct and foreign ones.

```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id          SERIAL      PRIMARY KEY,
  author_id   INT         NOT NULL  REFERENCES users (id),
  content     TEXT        NOT NULL,
  created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL  DEFAULT now()
);
```

```crystal
class User
  include Onyx::SQL::Model

  schema users do
    pkey id : Int32
    type name : String
    type authored_posts : Array(Post), foreign_key: "author_id"
  end
end

class Post
  include Onyx::SQL::Model

  schema posts do
    pkey id : Int32
    type content : String
    type author : User, key: "author_id"
  end
end

user = User.new(id: 2, name: "Archer")
post = Post.new(content: "Classic", author: user)
repo.exec(post.insert)

# [postgresql] INSERT INTO posts (content, author_id) VALUES (?, ?)
# The actual DB arguments are "Classic" and 2
```

Thanks to the `Query` builder, it is possible to build powerful type-safe joins in no time:

```crystal
posts = repo.query(Post
  .select(:id, :content)
  .join(author: true) do |q|
    q.select(:id, :name)
    q.where(name: "Archer")
  end)

pp posts.first # <Post @id=1 @content="Classic" @author=<User @id=2 @name="Archer">>
```

### Macros

[Onyx top-level macros](https://github.com/onyxframework/onyx#sql) allow to define top-level repository methods:

```crystal
require "onyx/env"
require "onyx/sql"

Onyx.query  # Singleton Onyx::SQL::Repository.query call
Onyx.exec   # ditto
Onyx.scalar # ditto
```
