## About üëã

Onyx::HTTP is a collection of [`HTTP::Handler`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/0.27.2/HTTP/Handler.html)'s to use in web [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) applications. It also includes a convenient [`HTTP::Server`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/0.27.2/HTTP/Server.html) wrapper. Onyx::HTTP shard serves as a foundation for higher-level Onyx components, such as [Onyx::REST](https://github.com/onyxframework/rest), but it can definetely be used as a stand-alone library.

## Installation üì•

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  onyx-http:
    github: onyxframework/http
    version: ~> 0.1.0
```

This shard follows [Semantic Versioning v2.0.0](http://semver.org/), so check [releases](https://github.com/onyxframework/http/releases) and change the `version` accordingly. Please visit [github.com/crystal-lang/shards](https://github.com/crystal-lang/shards) to know more about Crystal shards.

## Usage üíª

Onyx::HTTP includes multiple useful [`HTTP::Handler`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/0.27.2/HTTP/Handler.html)s and an [`HTTP::Server`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/0.27.2/HTTP/Server.html) wrapper. If you don't know anything about the Crystal HTTP server, then check out its [official docs](https://crystal-lang.org/reference/overview/http_server.html) and [API](https://crystal-lang.org/api/0.27.2/HTTP/Server.html) before continuing.

### Simple server

Start with a simple [`Onyx::HTTP::Server`](https://api.onyxframework.org/Onyx/HTTP/Server.html) example:

```crystal
require "onyx-http"

server = Onyx::HTTP::Server.new do |env|
  env.response << "Hello Onyx"
end

server.bind_tcp(5000)
server.listen
```

```sh
> curl http://localhost:5000
Hello Onyx
```

### Logging

We'd like to see the actual request in the STDOUT. Use [`Onyx::HTTP::Logger`](https://api.onyxframework.org/Onyx/HTTP/Logger.html) for that:

```crystal
require "onyx-http"

logger = Onyx::HTTP::Logger.new

server = Onyx::HTTP::Server.new(logger) do |env|
  env.response << "Hello Onyx"
end

server.bind_tcp(5000)
server.listen
```

```sh
> curl http://localhost:5000
Hello Onyx
```

![Screenshot #2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7955682/52903118-5fdf5d80-322a-11e9-84b2-2658a0051d08.png)

### Request meta

It's a good idea to add an ID to the request and also a time elapsed to process it for further analysis. There are [`Onyx::HTTP::RequestID`](https://api.onyxframework.org/Onyx/HTTP/RequestID.html) and [`Onyx::HTTP::ResponseTime`](https://api.onyxframework.org/Onyx/HTTP/ResponseTime.html) handlers:

```crystal
require "onyx-http"

logger = Onyx::HTTP::Logger.new
request_id = Onyx::HTTP::RequestID.new
response_time = Onyx::HTTP::ResponseTime.new

server = Onyx::HTTP::Server.new(response_time, request_id, logger) do |env|
  env.response << "Hello Onyx"
end

server.bind_tcp(5000)
server.listen
```

```sh
> curl http://localhost:5000 -v
* Rebuilt URL to: http://localhost:5000/
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 5000 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:5000
> User-Agent: curl/7.47.0
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Connection: keep-alive
< X-Request-ID: 14c0259b-c020-4c85-931c-556e1ff266da
< X-Response-Time: 120
< Content-Length: 10
<
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
Hello Onyx
```

### CORS

Modern APIs usually require proper [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) handling. It is achievable with [`Onyx::HTTP::CORS`](https://api.onyxframework.org/Onyx/HTTP/CORS.html):

```crystal
require "onyx-http"

logger = Onyx::HTTP::Logger.new
request_id = Onyx::HTTP::RequestID.new
response_time = Onyx::HTTP::ResponseTime.new
cors = Onyx::HTTP::CORS.new

server = Onyx::HTTP::Server.new(response_time, request_id, logger, cors) do |env|
  env.response << "Hello Onyx"
end

server.bind_tcp(5000)
server.listen

```

```sh
> curl http://localhost:5000 -v
* Rebuilt URL to: http://localhost:5000/
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 5000 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:5000
> User-Agent: curl/7.47.0
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Connection: keep-alive
< X-Request-ID: af4ded9e-2f72-41aa-bac2-308b38198af6
< Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
< X-Response-Time: 233
< Content-Length: 10
<
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
Hello Onyx
```

### Routing

Almost every web application requires routing. It is quite simple with [`Onyx::HTTP::Router`](https://api.onyxframework.org/Onyx/HTTP/Router.html):

```crystal
require "onyx-http"

logger = Onyx::HTTP::Logger.new
request_id = Onyx::HTTP::RequestID.new
response_time = Onyx::HTTP::ResponseTime.new

router = Onyx::HTTP::Router.new do
  get "/" do |env|
    env.response << "Hello Onyx"
  end

  post "/echo" do |env|
    env.response << env.request.body.try &.gets_to_end
  end
end

server = Onyx::HTTP::Server.new(response_time, request_id, logger, router)

server.bind_tcp(5000)
server.listen
```

```sh
> curl http://localhost:5000
Hello Onyx
> curl -X POST -d "Knock-knock" http://localhost:5000/echo
Knock-knock
```

![Screenshot #4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7955682/52903121-68379880-322a-11e9-9d45-0517d9e29dda.png)

### Rescuing

By default, an unhandled exception would halt the request processing, put the error backtrace into `STDERR` and print `500 Internal Server Error` into the response body. We can change this behaviour with [`Onyx::HTTP::Rescuer`](https://api.onyxframework.org/Onyx/HTTP/Rescuer.html).

This shard comes with [`Onyx::HTTP::Rescuers::Standard`](https://api.onyxframework.org/Onyx/HTTP/Rescuers/Standard.html), [`Onyx::HTTP::Rescuers::Silent`](https://api.onyxframework.org/Onyx/HTTP/Rescuers/Silent.html) and [`Onyx::HTTP::Rescuers::RouteNotFound`](https://api.onyxframework.org/Onyx/HTTP/Rescuers/RouteNotFound.html):

```crystal
require "onyx-http"

logger = Onyx::HTTP::Logger.new
request_id = Onyx::HTTP::RequestID.new
response_time = Onyx::HTTP::ResponseTime.new
rescuer = Onyx::HTTP::Rescuers::Standard(Exception).new
router_rescuer = Onyx::HTTP::Rescuers::RouteNotFound.new

router = Onyx::HTTP::Router.new do
  get "/" do |env|
    env.response << "Hello Onyx"
  end

  post "/echo" do |env|
    env.response << env.request.body.try &.gets_to_end
  end

  get "/error" do
    raise "Oops!"
  end
end

server = Onyx::HTTP::Server.new(response_time, request_id, logger, rescuer, router_rescuer, router)

server.bind_tcp(5000)
server.listen
```

```sh
> curl http://localhost:5000/error
500 Internal Server Error
> curl http://localhost:5000/unknown
404 Route Not Found: GET /unknown
```

![Screenshot #5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7955682/52903125-6c63b600-322a-11e9-908a-87d73948c24e.png)

### Macros

Now that you know how Onyx::HTTP works on the low-level, you'd probably want to reduce the amount of boilerplate code in your applications. We've got you covered! [**@onyxframework/onyx**](https://github.com/onyxframework/onyx) shard contains many top-level macros just for your convenience:

```crystal
require "onyx/env"
require "onyx/http"

Onyx.get "/" do |env|
  env.response << "Hello Onyx"
end

Onyx.listen
```

This example includes *all* the handlers listed above!

```sh
> curl http://localhost:5000 -v
* Rebuilt URL to: http://localhost:5000/
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 5000 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:5000
> User-Agent: curl/7.47.0
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Connection: keep-alive
< X-Request-ID: 89bbea1c-26b8-4113-ab67-04279eb0fa13
< Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
< X-Response-Time: 109
< Content-Length: 12
<
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
Hello, Onyx!
```

![Screenshot #6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7955682/52903126-6ff73d00-322a-11e9-8501-907d54a4f342.png)

You can easily modify the server's middleware:

```crystal
Onyx.listen do |handlers, server|
  # This code is going to be injected right before server.listen
  handlers.insert(1, MyCustomHandler.new)
end
```

### Next steps

As said before in the about section, Onyx::HTTP is just a foundation for other Onyx components. You may now want to check [Onyx::REST](https://github.com/onyxframework/rest) for a scalable REST API framework!

The decent Onyx::HTTP API documentation is always available at <https://api.onyxframework.org/http>.
