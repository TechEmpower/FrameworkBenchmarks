# Crystal-Moonshine

This is the [Moonshine](https://github.com/dhruvrajvanshi/Moonshine) test of the Framework Benchmarks. Crystal is a new language that closely resembles Ruby with a goal of removing typed variables and parameters (instead inferencing), whilst maintaining top speed through bindings into C.

Moonshine is a minimal web framework for the Crystal language.
