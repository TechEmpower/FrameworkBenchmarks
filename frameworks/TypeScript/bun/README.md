# [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun) Benchmarking Test

Bun is an all-in-one toolkit for JavaScript and TypeScript apps. It ships as a single executable called `bunâ€‹`.

At its core is the [Bun runtime](https://bun.sh/docs#what-is-a-runtime), a fast JavaScript runtime designed as a drop-in replacement for Node.js. It's written in Zig and powered by JavaScriptCore under the hood, dramatically reducing startup times and memory usage.

## Important Libraries

* [bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun)
* [postgres](https://github.com/porsager/postgres)
