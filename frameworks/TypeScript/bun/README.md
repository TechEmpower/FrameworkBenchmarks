# [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun) Benchmarking Test

[Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun) is an all-in-one toolkit for JavaScript and TypeScript apps. It ships as a single executable called `bunâ€‹`.

At its core is the [Bun runtime](https://bun.sh/docs#what-is-a-runtime), a fast JavaScript runtime designed as a drop-in replacement for Node.js. It's written in Zig and powered by JavaScriptCore under the hood, dramatically reducing startup times and memory usage.

HTTP & HTTPS Server is powered by a fork of [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets). [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/blob/main/packages/bun-types/bun.d.ts#L2050)
