# Hono Benchmarking Test

Hono - [ç‚Ž] means flameðŸ”¥ in Japanese - is a small, simple, and ultrafast web framework for the Edges. It works on any JavaScript runtime: Cloudflare Workers, Fastly Compute, Deno, Bun, Vercel, Lagon, AWS Lambda, Lambda@Edge, and Node.js. https://github.com/honojs/hono

## Important Libraries

The tests were run with:

- [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono)
- [Postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres/)

## Database

There are individual handlers for each DB approach. The logic for each of them are found here:

- [PostgreSQL](database/postgres.js)

There are **no database endpoints** or drivers attached by default.

To initialize the application with one of these, run any _one_ of the following commands:

```sh
$ DATABASE=postgres npm start
```
