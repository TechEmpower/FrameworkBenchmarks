This project provides representative performance measures across a wide field of web 
application frameworks. With much help from the community, coverage is quite broad and 
we are happy to broaden it further with contributions. The project presently includes 
frameworks on many languages including `Go`, `Python`, `Java`, `Ruby`, `PHP`, `C#`, `Clojure`, 
`Groovy`, `Dart`, `JavaScript`, `Erlang`, `Haskell`, `Scala`, `Perl`, `Lua`, `C`, and others.  The 
current tests exercise plaintext responses, JSON seralization, database reads 
and writes via the object-relational mapper (ORM), collections, sorting, server-side templates,
and XSS counter-measures. Future tests will exercise other components and greater computation.

For descriptions of the test types that we run, see the 
[test requirements section](http://frameworkbenchmarks.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Project-Information/Framework-Tests/).

If you find yourself in a directory or file that you're not sure what the purpose is, 
checkout our [file structure](http://frameworkbenchmarks.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Codebase/#file-structure) 
in our documenation, which will briefly explain the use of relevant directories and files.

## Quick Start Guide

Get started developing quickly by utilizing vagrant with TFB. [Git](http://git-scm.com), 
[Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) are 
required.

1. Clone TFB.

        $ git clone https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks.git

2. Move into the vagrant-development directory.

        $ cd FrameworkBenchmarks/deployment/vagrant-development

3. Turn on the VM (takes at least 20 minutes).

        $ vagrant up

4. Enter the VM.

        $ vagrant ssh

5. Move into the FrameworkBenchmarks directory in the vm.

        vagrant@TFB-all:~$ cd ~/FrameworkBenchmarks
        
6. Run a test.

        vagrant@TFB-all:~/FrameworkBenchmarks$ toolset/run-tests.py --install server --mode verify --test beego

_Note: `--install server` only needs to be added the first time that a tests is run. 
The dependencies should already be installed for subsequent runs._

_Note: In order to run the same test again the results (located at FrameworkBenchmarks/results) 
directory needs to be removed prior to running the test again. This directory is automatically 
added when tests are run._
