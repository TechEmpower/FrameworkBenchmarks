G-WAN is a Web application server with C/C++ & Objective-C/C++
scripts which takes around 100 KB of code in addition to be 
far faster than *all* other available Web application servers.

G-WAN also comes with a 'wait-free' Key-Value store, in-memory 
GIF I/O, bar/dot/line/pie/ring charts, frame-buffer 2D drawing,
compression, encryption, etc.

Servlets are 'edit & play' scripts that let you use the power
of compiled languages with the convenience of scripts.

G-WAN is free for all (commercial and non-profit users). Feel 
free to distribute it around you and to spread the word!
