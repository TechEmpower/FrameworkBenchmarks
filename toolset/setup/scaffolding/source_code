# This file should list the directories here that contain the actual source code

# https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc#Options
#
# For example, for a Java application that uses Maven, the content of this file
# might be:
#
# ./src/main/java
#
# (remove the '#' character in the line above or else cloc treats it as a comment)
