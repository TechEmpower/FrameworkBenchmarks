 Monkey HTTP Daemon - Install
 ============================

 For optimum performance, I recommend that Monkey be compiled with GCC >= 
 2.95.3 and be running on a Linux OS with kernel >= 2.6.32.

 Like every source program we must run 'configure' script and later
 'make':

 #./configure
 # make 
 
 Optionally, you have the option of 'make install', which will copy the main
 directory of monkey where it has been specified in the configure script.

 CONFIGURATION
 ===============
 monkey.conf is generated by ./configure (see above) and saved in conf/monkey.conf.  
 In this configuration file you can set the default port, and settings such as workers,
 timeouts, default user directions, etc.

 Running Monkey
 ==============

	bin/monkey

	or

	bin/monkey -D (to run monkey in background mode)
	
 Optionally, you can specify the directory where the configuration files
 are found, this can be done the following way: 

	bin/monkey -D -c conf/
	
 This argument (conf/) was thought of for those wishing to have Monkey
 running for various users, in distinctive Ports and it's own 
 configuration files. For more information see 'conf/monkey.conf'.

 For more info try -h option.

 Testing Monkey
 ==============
 
To see that Monkey is running, make a request from a browser, like lynx
or netscape:
 
 	# lynx 127.0.0.1:2001
 	
 Note: In this example the '2001' corresponds to the connection port
 assigned on 'conf/monkey.conf'.
