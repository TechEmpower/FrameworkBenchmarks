    # The CGI plugin requires a Match line to define which script will
    # be executed, as well it allows to define an interpreter and a
    # mime type, e.g:
    #
    # Match REGEX_EXPRESSION  INTERPRETER  MIMETYPE

    # Common execution for CGI files with .cgi extension with
    # executable permission located under the /cgi-bin/ directory
    Match /cgi-bin/.*\.cgi

    # Execute PHP scripts through php-cgi interpreter:
    Match /.*\.php /usr/bin/php-cgi application/x-httpd-php
