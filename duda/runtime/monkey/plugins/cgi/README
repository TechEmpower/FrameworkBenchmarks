CGI plugin
==========

This plugin provides plain old CGI, ie sh/perl/C/C++/etc
one-process-per-request architecture.

It's slow and using FastCGI instead is recommended, but building CGI
apps is rather easy and fast.


PHP
---

Note:
Using PHP via CGI is not recommended, you should use FastCGI instead.

To use PHP scripts via CGI, you need to make them executable, and either

1) add the usual linux script header to each (#!/path/to/php5-cgi)

or

2) bind .php to php5-cgi using binfmt-misc (recommended, a kernel-level lookup without
changing files)
