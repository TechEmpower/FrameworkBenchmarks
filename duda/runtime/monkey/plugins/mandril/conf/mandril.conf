# Monkey HTTP Daemon - Mandril
# ============================
# Mandril Plugin provide security rules to be applied to the incomming
# connections. If the client is rejected by some rule, it will get the
# 403 Forbidden error status.
#
# It supports two restriction modes, by request URI and by IP (or network
# range), make sure all your rules are defined under the section [RULES]:
#
#  a) Restriction by request URI:
#
#     You can define multiple keywords to restrict a specific incoming
#     request which hold that string. Check this example:
#
#     [RULES]
#         URL documents
#         URL pictures
#         URL /private
#
#  b) Restriction by IP or network range:
#
#     Multiple rules can be defined to deny the access to specific incoming
#     clients:
#
#     [RULES]
#         IP  10.20.1.1/24
#         IP 192.168.3.150
#
#     In the first rule we are blocking a range of IPs from 10.20.1.1 to
#     10.20.1.255. In the second example just one specific IP address.
#
# It also supports denying hotlinking from other domains.
#
#  c)
#
#     [RULES]
#         deny_hotlink /imgs
#
#     This rule will prevent access to all files under /imgs if the
#     request's Referer header is not from the same domain or its
#     subdomains.
#     If the Referer header is missing, the request will be accepted.
#
# You can mix the rules type under the [RULE] section, so the following example
# is totally valid:
#
# [RULES]
#     URL documents
#     URL pictures
#     URL /private
#     IP  10.20.1.1/24
#     IP  192.168.3.150
#

[RULES]
    # IP 127.0.0.1
    # URL /imgs
