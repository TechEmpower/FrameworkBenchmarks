## FastCGI proxy configuration.
##
## To enable this plugin you'll need at least one [FASTCGI_LOCATION] with
## at least one [FASTCGI_SERVER]. If any key inside a directive is
## duplicated, one will be ignored and no warnings issued. The order of
## directives and keys is not significant.
##
##
## Example php5-fmp configuration.
##
## This configuration handles php scripts using php5-fpm running on
## localhost.
##
#[FASTCGI_SERVER]
	## Each server must have a unique name.
	## (Required)
	# ServerName php5-fpm1

	## Depending on your version of php5-fpm, one of these should be
	## enabled. ServerAddr is used in the default pool.d/www.conf on
	## Debian Squeeze.
	## (One of either required)
	# ServerAddr 127.0.0.1:9000
	# ServerPath /var/run/php5-fpm.sock

	## Concurrent connections.
	## (Optional, default 1)
	# MaxConnections 5

#[FASTCGI_LOCATION]
	## Each location should have a unique name for easier debugging.
	## (Optional, default auto-generated)
	# LocationName php5_location

	## Space separated list of location servers.
	## (Required)
	# ServerNames php5-fpm1

	## Keep FastCGI server connections alive. Please tune the
	## MaxConnections on [FASTCGI_SERVER] directives and the Worker
	## count under [SERVER] in monkey.conf (Threads may stall if
	## available concurrent connections is less then number of
	## workers.)
	## (Optional, default Off)
	# KeepAlive On

	## Space separated list of match regex. If regex overlapp with
	## another location, one of them will be ignored and no warnings
	## will be issued.
	##
	## For security purposes only render .php files in certain
	## directories. The matching is done on the real path of
	## requested file so something like this could be used.
	## Match ^/var/htdocs/wordpress/(.*).php$
	##
	## This one will render all php scripts in any directory.
	## (Required)
	# Match /*.php

##
## Example minimal libfcgi TCP configuration
##
# [FASTCGI_SERVER]
	# ServerName test_server1
	# ServerAddr 127.0.0.1:7999

# [FASTCGI_LOCATION]
	# ServerNames test_server1
	# Match /fcgitest
