FastCGI plugin
==============

This is a FastCGI proxy plugin for the [Monkey HTTP daemon](http://monkey-project.com/).

The module proxies requests to FastCGI application servers. It does not
itself spawn any server instances, instead relying on the user to spawn
these using third-party tools such as php5-fpm, fcgi-cgi or spawn-fcgi.

Features
========

* Supports the responder FastCGI application role.
* Supports persistent connections.
* Handle multiple locations, served by multiple severs.
* Distributes available server connections fairly.
* Serves request almost first in, first out per location.
  (A fast location may break the ordering for a slower location,
  but a request will always be served.)

Requirements
============

* Latest [Monkey HTTP daemon](http://monkey-project.com/) git master.
