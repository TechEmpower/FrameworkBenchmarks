Before opening an issue, please make sure you have checked the documentation for help/answers at https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/wiki

If this is a feature request, please check the project roadmaps first at https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/projects

If this is a request for a new language/framework, please check the wiki at https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/wiki/Suggested-Frameworks,-Languages-and-Features and
make sure it's not already there.

If this issue is related to personal benchmarking numbers versus official round results, please make sure you are testing on the same commit that the round was released on and that your machine setup is similar to the specs listed for that round otherwise it will be extremely difficult to reproduce results. Rounds are tagged at https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/releases

For errors with setup, frameworks, or the toolset, please make sure you are on the most current `master` branch. Provide as many logs as possible. For larger logs you can use http://sprunge.us/ then follow the template below:
