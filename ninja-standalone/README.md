# Ninja Framework Benchmarking Test

This is the [Ninja-standalone](http://www.ninjaframework.org/) portion of a [benchmarking test suite](../) comparing a variety of web development platforms.

## IMPORTANT!!!!

ninja-resin is in essence just a copy of ninja-standalone with different datasources.
That means all stuff you change in ninja-resin should also be applied to 
ninja-standalone and vice-versa.
